- Task creation, scheduling, priority management, and SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing)
- Inter-task communication (queues, semaphores, mutexes, event groups)
- ESP-IDF heap implementation integration (not vanilla FreeRTOS heap)
- Advanced task management: Idle Tasks, Timer Task, IPC Tasks, ESP Timer Task
- Critical section handling, interrupt service routines, and system reliability
- Task synchronization patterns, deadlock prevention, and real-time statistics

**IoT System Architecture:**
- Clean architecture principles and hexagonal architecture for embedded systems
